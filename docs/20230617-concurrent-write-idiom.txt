In updater G, single one:

    conf2 := conf.DeepCopy()
    conf2.Set(path, value)
    conf.SwapToNewVersion(conf2)

In the G, who wants to write:

    conf.SendSet(path, value) // works via chan

In any concurrent user G:

    Always periodically get the conf from centralized place, because the pointer may change.
